# My-NBA-game-analysis

# Overview

## This project provides tools and scripts for analyzing NBA game data. Whether you're looking to break down player stats, team performance, or game trends, this repository aims to simplify the process with clean, reusable code and insightful outputs.
## Features

    Data Collection: Scripts to fetch NBA game data from public APIs or datasets.
    Analysis: Tools to compute statistics like points per game, shooting efficiency, or win/loss trends.
    Visualization: Generate charts and graphs for intuitive insights (e.g., player performance over time).
    Custom Queries: Filter data by team, player, season, or specific games.

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.8+ (or your preferred language)
    Required libraries (listed in requirements.txt):
        pandas - Data manipulation
        matplotlib - Visualization
        requests - API calls (if applicable)
    Access to an NBA data source (e.g., NBA API, Kaggle dataset, or web scraping)

# Installation

    Clone this repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/AsanAshirov/nba-game-analysis-.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd nba-game-analysis-
Install dependencies:
bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

    Prepare Data: Place your NBA dataset (e.g., CSV, JSON) in the data/ folder or configure the script to fetch live data.
    Run Analysis:
    bash

    python analyze_games.py --season 2024 --team "Los Angeles Lakers"
        Replace arguments as needed (see script documentation for options).
    View Results: Outputs are saved to the outputs/ folder as CSVs, charts, or text files.
